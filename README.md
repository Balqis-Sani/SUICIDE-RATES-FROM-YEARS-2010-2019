The analysis of suicide trends from 2010 to 2019 reveals critical patterns and underlying factors impacting mental health. The year 2010 marked the highest number of recorded suicides, with 300 cases, possibly reflecting unique societal and economic stressors during that period. Over the decade, a persistent gender disparity was observed, with males consistently exhibiting higher suicide rates, highlighting the need for targeted mental health interventions. Additionally, the surge in social media usage, particularly in 2019, raised concerns about its potential influence on mental well-being, emphasizing the importance of exploring the relationship between digital behavior and mental health outcomes. Together, these findings underscore the need for multifaceted strategies to address mental health challenges in a rapidly evolving social and digital landscape.




# OBSERVATIONS

Peak Suicides Recorded in 2010:

The year 2010 stood out with the highest number of recorded suicides, totaling 300 cases. This spike may be indicative of unique societal, economic, or cultural challenges during that period. Further analysis could help identify specific factors, such as economic downturns, policy changes, or major events, contributing to this increase in suicide cases.

Male Prevalence in Suicide Rates:

Over the decade from 2010 to 2019, males consistently exhibited higher suicide rates compared to other genders. This trend highlights a persistent gender disparity in mental health outcomes, possibly driven by societal pressures, limited help-seeking behavior among men, or underlying socioeconomic and psychological factors. The data underscores the need for targeted mental health interventions for men.

Rising Social Media Usage in 2019:

Social media platforms, notably Facebook and Twitter, experienced a sharp increase in usage in 2019. This period coincided with growing concerns around the impact of social media on mental health, including issues like cyberbullying, unrealistic social comparisons, and information overload. The correlation between increased social media engagement and mental health challenges during this time warrants further investigation to explore causative links and inform preventive strategies.


# RECOMMENDATIONS

1.Address Gender-Specific Mental Health Needs:

Develop targeted interventions and support systems for males, focusing on mental health awareness, counseling, and breaking societal stigmas around seeking help.




2.Strengthen Suicide Prevention Initiatives:

Analyze what might have triggered the peak in 2010 and apply those insights to prevent similar spikes.
Implement consistent mental health screenings and suicide hotlines across communities.




3.Monitor Social Media Impact:

Collaborate with social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to promote positive, non-triggering content.
Advocate for content moderation policies to reduce exposure to harmful or triggering posts.




4.Enhance Education on Mental Health:

Introduce educational programs in schools and workplaces to teach emotional resilience and coping mechanisms.
Promote community mental health support groups where individuals can share experiences and access resources.
